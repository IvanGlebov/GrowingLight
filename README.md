# GrowingLight

Project created to maintain ESP8266 board with different sensors.

This project is specifecly build to interact with Blynk server

All settings can be set in Blynk application, except application key, network ssid and password.
These settings now shoud be entered in code. In the future versions there may be a fix for it, but chances are really low.
